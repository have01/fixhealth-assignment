Running a GitHub React project typically involves cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and starting the development server. Below are step-by-step instructions for running a GitHub React project using the instructions provided in the project's README:

1.Clone the Repository:
Go to the GitHub repository of the React project that you want to run.
Click the "Code" button and copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repo.git).
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project, and run the following command to clone the repository:

2.Navigate to the Project Directory:
Use the cd command to move into the project directory:

Run one of the following commands based on your preferred package manager:
Using cmd : npm install
