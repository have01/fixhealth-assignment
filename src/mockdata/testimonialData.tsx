It should focus on those complications which are uncommon because it is hard to find a suitable doctor in some cases like Varicocele, Esinophill count increase",

She quickly diagnosed my disease as pulmonary embolism and I was admitted to ICU. Now it's all fine. If I would have gotten late then I wouldn't be writing this. Thanks Practo!",

Plus it gave me reminders with the names of my meds..",

No waste of time anymore, prescription is also available on the app, reminding you what to take when to take it, a link to Uber is also available after booking an appointment, it's really the app to have!
